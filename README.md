# Match 3 Solver Website
An algorithm that solves a finite match 3 game to completion.

## Info
This repository is solely for the purpose of hosting the match 3 solver that is being developed in a seperate github repository at https://github.com/MiniMage7/Match3Solver  
You can find the hosted website at https://www.match3solve.com/

### Impossible solves
If you encountered a solve that the website wasn't able to solve, there is a decent chance it can be solved by the rust program found in the above repository. Unfortunately there is at least 1 puzzle that is simply too large for this program to handle, and unless someone would like to suggest a method to combat that, this project will remain as it is for solve methods.
